# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest released version of PhotoStructure is supported.

## Responsible disclosure security policy

We consider the security of our users a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into security, there may still be vulnerabilities present.

## Reporting a security issue

If you find a vulnerability in PhotoStructure, _or even think you have_, please contact us via a **private channel**.

Please use whatever channel is most convenient for you:

- send an email to [security@photostructure.com](mailto:security@photostructure.com), or
- send a direct forum message to [@mrm](https://forum.photostructure.com/u/mrm/summary), or
- send a direct message to @photostructure on [discord](https://photostructure/go/discord)

Expect a reply in under 36 hours. Please try an alternative contact method if you don't get a response.

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue to report vulnerabilities.**

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of the projectâ€™s team members at risk.

## Thank you!

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.
