# -----------
# PS_ENV_FILE
# -----------
#
# PhotoStructure will attempt to read an .env-formatted filename specified by
# this environment variable. This must be a full pathname.
#
# Any value set by this file will override values in settings.toml files.
#
# For more details see https://photostructure.com/go/psenv


# -------------
# PS_CONFIG_DIR
# -------------
#
# If the environment variable PS_CONFIG_DIR is set, PhotoStructure will use
# that value as your system configuration directory. This can't be overridden
# in the system settings.toml, as it's used to _find_ the system
# settings.toml!
#
# PhotoStructure's system configuration directory is different for every
# operating system:
#
# - Windows defaults to %APPDATA%PhotoStructure (%APPDATA% is normally set to
# %HOME%/AppData/Roaming)
#
# - macOS defaults to ~/Library/Application Support/PhotoStructure
#
# - Linux defaults to ${XDG_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.config}/PhotoStructure

# ----------------------------
# PS_LIBRARY_DIR or libraryDir
# ----------------------------
#
# This is the absolute path to your PhotoStructure library. If missing, or set
# to an empty string, the welcome page will be shown when PhotoStructure
# launches. Use native file separators (so on windows, use back-slashes).

#
# PS_SCAN_ALL_DRIVES="true"


# --------------------------
# PS_SCAN_PATHS or scanPaths
# --------------------------
#
# This holds an array of absolute paths to scan for assets. If you are setting
# this via an environment variable, you may use either standard PATH
# formatting, like `PS_SCAN_PATHS="/path/one:/path/two"`, or use JSON
# encoding, like `PS_SCAN_PATHS='["/path/one","/path/two"]'`.

# ------------------------
# PS_CACHE_DIR or cacheDir
# ------------------------
#
# Where would you like PhotoStructure's scratch file directory? This must be a
# fast, local disk with several gigabytes free.
#
# Note that if PS_FORCE_LOCAL_DB_REPLICA is enabled, the local DB replica will
# be stored in this directory while PhotoStructure is running: don't delete
# it!
#
# If this is set to /tmp PhotoStructure will write to a user-specific
# /tmp/.photostructure-cache-$UID directory.
#
# PS_CACHE_DIR="/home/user/.cache/photostructure"


# ------------------------------------------------
# PS_FORCE_LOCAL_DB_REPLICA or forceLocalDbReplica
# ------------------------------------------------
#
# Libraries on remote filesystems can suffer from bad performance and
# inconsistent transactions due to slow file I/O and missing file locking
# mechanics. When opening libraries on remote filesystems, or if this setting
# is `true`, PhotoStructure will copy the library database to the `cacheDir`
# and perform I/O against this local replica. Changes made to the local db
# replica are then periodically copied back to the remote library.
#
# If you've overridden this value in the past, know that v23.5 and after
# should automatically set this to the correct value for you.
#
# For more details, see
# https://forum.photostructure.com/t/whats-force-local-db-replica/837 and

# --------------------------------
# PS_ORIGINALS_DIR or originalsDir
# --------------------------------
#
# This is the directory that PhotoStructure uses to store original images when
# "copyAssetsToLibrary" is enabled. Absolute paths are supported. Relative
# paths are evaluated from your libraryDir. This setting defaults to ".",
# which is the same as your PhotoStructure library directory, unless you are
# on docker, and a /ps/originals directory exists.
#
# If you open your PhotoStructure library on a different computer, and that
# computer doesn't have access to your originals volume, full-screen zoom
# won't work, and non-transcoded videos will not play.
#
# This system setting needs to be set appropriately on different computers (it
# won't be set automatically!)
#
# If you have a large library and want to use an SSD, we recommend you set
# your libraryDir to your SSD, and use this setting to store your originals on
# a larger volume, rather than using the "previewsDir" setting.

# optional and only used by PhotoStructure for Servers. Make sure the UID/GID
# that PhotoStructure runs as can read and write to this file.
#
# Aliases: "PIDFILE"
#
# PS_PID_FILE=""


# ------------------------------
# PS_PREVIEWS_DIR or previewsDir
# ------------------------------
#
# This is the directory that PhotoStructure uses to store preview images. This
# defaults to the ".photostructure/previews" directory inside your
# PhotoStructure library. Absolute paths here are supported, but if you keep
# your library and previews directory separated, take care when you open your
# library on different computers, as this setting needs to be adjusted for
# those computers as well.
#
# NOTE: "originalDirs" is recommended instead of this setting; If you get
# "previewsDir" wrong, your library won't work. If you get "originalsDir"
# wrong, you just break full-screen asset zooming and playback for
# non-transcoded videos.

# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# Volumes with these filesystem types will never be scanned or imported.
#
# These are only relevant to Linux and macOS systems.

# ----------------------------------------------
# PS_FILE_COPY_ONLY_NATIVE or fileCopyOnlyNative
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# Should PhotoStructure skip the built-in file copy code, and only use the "OS
# native" file copy mechanism?
#
# PhotoStructure is typically faster than native file copies by 2x or more.
#
# If true, PhotoStructure will use "ditto" on macOS, "cp" on Linux, and
# "Copy-Item" via PowerShell on Windows.
#
# Aliases: "PS_ONLY_NATIVE_FILE_COPY"
#
# PS_FILE_COPY_ONLY_NATIVE="false"


# -------------------------------------
# PS_FILE_COPY_VERIFY or fileCopyVerify
# -------------------------------------
#
# Should PhotoStructure verify all file copies by comparing SHAs of the source
# and destination? This shouldn't be necessary on most OSes and filesystems,
# and slows down library imports.
#
# Aliases: "PS_VERIFY_FILE_COPY or PS_VERIFY_FILE_COPIES"
#
# PS_FILE_COPY_VERIFY="true"


# ------------------------------------------------
# PS_FILE_COPY_WITH_REFLINK or fileCopyWithReflink
# ------------------------------------------------
#
# Should PhotoStructure use Node.js's COPYFILE_FICLONE flag? If true, file
# copy operations will attempt to create a copy-on-write reflink. If the
# platform does not support copy-on-write, then a fallback copy mechanism is
# used. Note that this defaulted to true in previous versions of
# PhotoStructure, but benchmarks show it to be (much) slower on Windows and it
# may be problematic over NFS, so the default is now false.

# PS_FILE_COPY_WITH_REFLINK="false"


# -----------------------------------------
# PS_MOUNTPOINTS_TTL_MS or mountpointsTtlMs
# -----------------------------------------
#
# How frequently should PhotoStructure scan for new volumes (so PhotoStructure
# can detect when drives are inserted or ejected)? Shorter than 10-15 seconds
# may cause issues on Windows. A value of 0 will cache indefinitely. This
# defaults to 15 minutes on Windows, which relies on polling. On Linux and
# macOS this is set to 0 because findmnt/gio and diskutil notify mountpoint
# changes without polling.
#
# PS_MOUNTPOINTS_TTL_MS="1m"


# ------------------------------
# PS_STAT_RETRIES or statRetries
# ------------------------------
#
# If a stat or readdir times out, how many times can PhotoStructure retry
# before giving up?.
#
# Set to 0 to disable retries.
#
# PS_STAT_RETRIES="3"


# -----------------------------------
# PS_STAT_TIMEOUT_MS or statTimeoutMs
# -----------------------------------
#
# Filesystem traversal can be dangerous business with scratched CDROMs and old
# busted hard drives. To prevent PhotoStructure from getting "stuck" when
# trying to read these devices, it will timeout directory iteration if stat()
# or readdir() exceeds this value. The default of 30 seconds should cover most
# issues with spun-down hard drives and NAS/WAN latency.
#
# Set to 0 to disable.
#
# Aliases: "PS_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS or PS_FS_TIMEOUT_MS"
#
# PS_STAT_TIMEOUT_MS="30s"


# -------------------------------------
# PS_TRY_SOFT_DELETES or trySoftDeletes
# -------------------------------------
#
# If true, "Empty Trash" will _try_ to move files into the "Trash can" or
# "Recycle bin", when possible. If moving a file into the trash can fails (due
# to permissions or filesystem functionality), the file will be "hard" deleted
# (or "unlinked").
#
# This setting defaults to false on docker. For more details, see
# https://photostructure.com/go/docker-soft-delete
#
# PS_TRY_SOFT_DELETES="true"


# -----------------------------
# PS_USE_FS_WATCH or useFsWatch
# -----------------------------
#
# If true, PhotoStructure will use the native filesystem watch APIs to detect
# file changes. This is the default and recommended setting. If false,
# PhotoStructure will poll the filesystem for changes instead. This is not
# recommended, but may be useful if you're running PhotoStructure on an OS or
# filesystem that doesn't support change notifications, like some network
# filesystems.
#
# For more details see https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#availability
#
# PS_USE_FS_WATCH="true"


# ----------------------------------------------
# PS_VALIDATE_MOUNTPOINTS or validateMountpoints
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# When true, PhotoStructure ignores volumes whose mountpoints do not exist. If
# any volumes are unhealthy, though, this may wedge volume handlers.
#
# PS_VALIDATE_MOUNTPOINTS="true"


# ---------------------------------------
# PS_WATCH_DEBOUNCE_MS or watchDebounceMs
# ---------------------------------------
#
# How long to wait for a file to "settle down" and stop changing before the
# file watcher notifies listeners that the file changed. Some applications
# (like PhotoStructure) use work-in-progress "atomic" writes, but many
# applications overwrite in-place, which can cause the file watcher to see
# incomplete results until the write process is complete.
#
# The default is 500ms (½ second) to handle slow remote NASes and slow-writing
# applications.
#
# Set to 0 to disable.

# Set this to 0 to never cache to the filesystem.
#
# PS_FS_CACHE_SLOW_MS="25ms"


# ---------------------------------
# PS_IMAGE_CACHE_MS or imageCacheMs
# ---------------------------------
#
# Assets requiring conversion may need intermediary file storage as they are
# imported. These intermediary files only need to live as long as the import
# process for that asset. Too short of a time will result in this conversion
# work being re-done during import. Too long of a time will result in
# additional diskspace in your cache directory being consumed.

# PS_LOG_FLUSH_MS or logFlushMs
# -----------------------------
#
# How frequently should PhotoStructure flush log entries to disk? Lower values
# will result in more frequent writes to disk, but will also reduce the amount

# - If any patterns resolve to including forward-slashes, know that will be
# interpreted as subdirectories.
#
# - If you want to add a static path, escape the pathname with single quotes
# (like "'photos'/y/MM/dd").
#
# - The result of this will always be interpreted as a relative path from your

#
# Options: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower,
# veryslow.

#
# - Universal support: Works in ALL browsers on ALL platforms
#
# - Fast encoding speed
#
# - Larger files than HEVC
#
# **libx265 (HEVC/H.265)** - For Apple-only or storage-constrained setups
#
# - 25-40% smaller files than H.264
#
# - 2-5x slower encoding
#
# HEVC browser support:
#
# - Safari (macOS/iOS): Full support since Safari 11
#
# - Chrome (all platforms): Supported since v107
#
# - Edge (Windows): Supported with hardware decode
#
# - Firefox: NO native support (requires OS-level codecs)
#
#   - macOS: Works if system HEVC codec available
#
#   - Windows: Firefox 134+ with HEVC Video Extensions from Microsoft Store
#
#   - Linux: Firefox 137+ with VA-API hardware decode
#
# **Choose HEVC if:** You only use Safari/Chrome, or Apple devices, and want
# smaller files.
#
# **Stick with H.264 if:** You use Firefox on Linux/Windows, or need universal
# compatibility.
