# |  copyAssetsToLibrary  |
# +-----------------------+
#
# Should PhotoStructure copy photos and videos to your PhotoStructure Library?
# This setting holds the value for the welcome page's "May PhotoStructure
# organize your photos and videos?" section. Read more about this setting

# <https://photostructure.com/getting-started/automatic-library-organization/>.
#
# PS_COPY_ASSETS_TO_LIBRARY="true"


# +--------------+
# |  libraryDir  |
# +--------------+
#
# This is the absolute path to your PhotoStructure library. If missing, or set
# to an empty string, the welcome page will be shown when PhotoStructure

# |  scanPaths  |
# +-------------+
#
# This holds an array of absolute paths to scan for assets. If you are setting
# this via an environment variable, you may use either standard PATH
# formatting, like `PS_SCAN_PATHS="/path/one:/path/two"`, or use JSON
# encoding, like `PS_SCAN_PATHS='["/path/one","/path/two"]'`.
#
# PS_SCAN_PATHS="[]"


# +------------+
# |  cacheDir  |
# +------------+
#
# Where would you like PhotoStructure's scratch file directory? This must be a
# fast, local disk with several gigabytes free.
#
# Note that if PS_FORCE_LOCAL_DB_REPLICA is enabled, the local DB replica will
# be stored in this directory while PhotoStructure is running: don't delete
# it!

# PS_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/photostructure"


# +-----------------------+
# |  forceLocalDbReplica  |
# +-----------------------+
#
# Libraries on remote filesystems can suffer from bad performance and
# inconsistent transactions due to slow file I/O and missing file locking
# mechanics. When opening libraries on remote filesystems, or if this setting
# is `true`, PhotoStructure will copy the library database to the `cacheDir`
# and perform I/O against this local replica. Changes made to the local db
# replica are then periodically copied back to the remote library.
#
# For details, see

# +----------------+
# |  originalsDir  |
# +----------------+
#
# This is the directory that PhotoStructure uses to store original images when
# "copyAssetsToLibrary" is enabled. Absolute paths are supported. Relative
# paths are evaluated from your libraryDir. This setting defaults to ".",
# which is the same as your PhotoStructure library directory, unless you are
# on docker, and a /ps/originals directory exists.
#
# If you open your PhotoStructure library on a different computer, and that
# computer doesn't have access to your originals volume, full-screen zoom
# won't work, and non-transcoded videos will not play.
#
# This system setting needs to be set appropriately on different computers (it
# won't be set automatically!)
#
# If you have a large library and want to use an SSD, we recommend you set
# your libraryDir to your SSD, and use this setting to store your originals on
# a larger volume, rather than using the "previewsDir" setting.
#
# See <https://forum.photostructure.com/t/hybrid-photostructure-libraries/775>

# +---------------+
# |  previewsDir  |
# +---------------+
#
# This is the directory that PhotoStructure uses to store preview images. This
# defaults to the ".photostructure/previews" directory inside your
# PhotoStructure library. Absolute paths here are supported, but if you keep
# your library and previews directory separated, take care when you open your
# library on different computers, as this setting needs to be adjusted for
# those computers as well.
#
# NOTE: "originalDirs" is recommended instead of this setting; If you get
# "previewsDir" wrong, your library won't work. If you get "originalsDir"
# wrong, you just break full-screen asset zooming and playback for
# non-transcoded videos.

# Settings for System.timeouts:
#


# +--------------------+
# |  commandTimeoutMs  |
# +--------------------+
#
# How long should PhotoStructure wait for a command that touches the
# filesystem (and doesn't do anything computationally expensive)? Note that
# external hard drives can take 10-15 seconds to spin up, and antivirus apps
# can hang for tens of seconds on slow machines, so values less than the
# default may result in timeouts.
#
# PS_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS="PT12S"


# +-----------------+
# |  debugTimeouts  |
# +-----------------+
#
# Should PhotoStructure log timeout sources? Note that this instrumentation
# has a performance impact.
#
# PS_DEBUG_TIMEOUTS="false"


# +------------------------+
# |  maxSyncFileTimeoutMs  |
# +------------------------+
#
# This is the longest PhotoStructure will be willing to wait for any given
# file to be imported.
#
# Note that sync file timeouts are normally less than this, based on the input
# file's resolution, filetype, and, if it's a video, it's duration.
#
# PS_MAX_SYNC_FILE_TIMEOUT_MS="PT20M"


# +--------------------+
# |  mountpointsTtlMs  |
# +--------------------+
#
# How frequently should PhotoStructure scan for new volumes (so PhotoStructure
# can detect when drives are inserted or ejected)? Shorter than 10-15 seconds
# may cause issues on Windows. This defaults to 15 minutes on Windows, which
# relies on polling. On Linux and macOS this is set to 0 because findmnt/gio
# and diskutil notify mountpoint changes without polling.
#
# PS_MOUNTPOINTS_TTL_MS="PT1M"


# +-----------------+
# |  statTimeoutMs  |
# +-----------------+
#
# Filesystem traversal can be dangerous business with scratched CDROMs and old
# busted hard drives. To prevent PhotoStructure from getting "stuck" when
# trying to read these devices, it will timeout directory iteration if stat()
# or readdir() exceeds this value. The default of 30 seconds should cover most
# issues with spun-down hard drives and NAS/WAN latency.
#
# PS_STAT_TIMEOUT_MS="PT30S"


# +-----------------+
# |  taskTimeoutMs  |
# +-----------------+
#
# What's the longest time it can validly take to fetch a file SHA, generate
# image previews for an asset, compute an image hash, or extract tags for a
# file?
#
# On a reasonable server and disk, these tasks should take a handful of
# seconds, but the default allows for a (busy!) RPi on a slow, remote disk to
# not timeout.
#
# PS_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS="PT2M"


# +-----------------------+
# |  volumeMetadataTtlMs  |
# +-----------------------+
#
# How frequently should PhotoStructure reload volume metadata (like
# bytes-free, which is used in a health check)? Values less than a minute are
# not necessary.

# PS_VOLUME_METADATA_TTL_MS="PT15M"



##############################################################################
#
# Settings for System.networking:
#


# +----------------------------+
# |  exposeNetworkWithoutAuth  |
# +----------------------------+
#
# Normally the web service is only accessible to the computer running
# PhotoStructure. Setting this to true will expose your library to all
# computers on your network. You should own or trust all systems on that
# network, as there is no auth in PhotoStructure currently. Future versions of
# PhotoStructure will add authorization mechanisms, at which point this
# setting will be deleted.
#
# **Don't enable this unless you know what you are doing**.
#
# PS_EXPOSE_NETWORK_WITHOUT_AUTH="false"


# +------------+
# |  httpPort  |

# PS_HTTP_PORT="1787"


# +-------------+
# |  localhost  |
# +-------------+
#
# If "exposeNetworkWithoutAuth" is false, what value should PhotoStructure use

# +--------------+
# |  trustProxy  |
# +--------------+
#
# Support for PhotoStructure instances running behind a reverse proxy. See
# <http://expressjs.com/en/guid/behind-proxies.html>. This setting should
# either be "false" (don't trust any proxies), "loopback", (only trust
# loopback/localhost), a single subnet (like "192.168.1.0/24"), or a
# comma-delimited set of subnets.

##############################################################################
#
# Settings for System.processes:
#


# +------------------+
# |  cpuLoadPercent  |
# +------------------+
#
# This setting is a rough goal for PhotoStructure to load the system during
# library synchronization. A higher value here will allow PhotoStructure to
# run more tasks in parallel, but may impact your system's responsiveness.
# Setting this value to 0 will still allow 1 import to run.
#
# This setting is ignored if "maxConcurrentImports" and

# Min value: 0
# Max value: 200
#
# PS_CPU_LOAD_PERCENT="75"


# +-------------------------+
# |  exiftoolProcsPerChild  |
# +-------------------------+
#
# Each PhotoStructure process spins up an ExifTool when needed. Note that the
# "web" and "sync" services use exiftool, so the total number of exiftool
# processes will be several times larger than this value. If this is unset,
# this will default to roughly 50% of the number of supported concurrent
# imports.
#
# PS_EXIFTOOL_PROCS_PER_CHILD=""


# +---------------------------+
# |  fatalErrorRatePerMinute  |
# +---------------------------+
#
# If PhotoStructure sees errors at a higher rate per minute than this setting,
# PhotoStructure will shut down. If this value is too high, PhotoStructure may
# look busy, but it's just busy failing. If this value is set too low,
# temporary errors (due to network flakiness or USB hiccups) might shut down
# PhotoStructure needlessly.
#
# PS_FATAL_ERROR_RATE_PER_MINUTE="20"


# +-----------------+
# |  ffmpegThreads  |
# +-----------------+
#
# When transcoding videos, what value should we give to "ffmpeg -threads"?
#
# This defaults to min(1, <# of cpus> * cpuLoadPercent / 4).
#
# Note that "ffmpeg -threads" _most likely doesn't do what you expect_: a
# value of 0 will consume all CPUs (which is why it isn't allowed). A value of
# N will actually mean > N CPUs are used (due to demux threading and other
# details). See <https://stackoverflow.com/a/41010102>.
#
# PS_FFMPEG_THREADS=""


# +-----------+
# |  inspect  |
# +-----------+

#
# This setting is transient and only set via environment variables.
#
#
# PS_INSPECT="false"


# +------------------------+
# |  maxConcurrentImports  |
# +------------------------+
#
# How many imports can PhotoStructure schedule concurrently? This will be
# clamped between 1 and 32.
#
# If not set, a sensible value will be computed based on "cpuLoadPercent".
#
# If set explicitly, this and "sharpThreadsPerProcess" will override
# "cpuLoadPercent" and "maxConcurrentImportsWhenRemote" settings.
#
# PS_MAX_CONCURRENT_IMPORTS=""


# +----------------------------------+
# |  maxConcurrentImportsWhenRemote  |
# +----------------------------------+
#
# How many concurrent files can be imported if the library is on a remote
# volume? This defaults to 2 to try to avoid overwhelming HDD I/O on the
# remote NAS. If this is larger than (cpus.length * cpuLoadPercent) or max
# child processes given available memory, this value will be ignored.
#
# PS_MAX_CONCURRENT_IMPORTS_WHEN_REMOTE="2"


# +---------------+
# |  maxMemoryMb  |
# +---------------+
#
# PhotoStructure will restart services if they use more than this value
# (measured in megabytes, or 1,000,000 bytes). Note that this is not the

# PS_MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_RETRIES_MS="PT0.25S"


# +--------------------------+
# |  minDelayBetweenSpawnMs  |
# +--------------------------+
#
# The shorter this time is, the faster PhotoStructure will ramp up parallelism
# at the start of a sync. Having a larger value here mitigates initial system

# |  minDiskFreeGb  |
# +-----------------+
#
# PhotoStructure will pause processing if the GB free on the disk that your
# library is stored on drops below this value. The value provided here will be
# multiplied by 1000^3. Note that many OSes will corrupt themselves when disks
# fill up, and SSDs can fail as they approach full capacity. A value of less
# than 8 may be unsafe (due to hibernation and OS update files).
#
# Set this value to 0 to disable free disk space health checks.
#
# PS_MIN_DISK_FREE_GB="6"


# +-----------------------------------+
# |  minTimeBetweenServiceRestartsMs  |
# +-----------------------------------+
#
# If a service (like web or sync) is restarted due to an error, how many
# milliseconds must elapse before another restart is allowed? This helps
# prevent system load due to service flapping.
#
# PS_MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_SERVICE_RESTARTS_MS="PT7S"


# +------------------+
# |  pollIntervalMs  |
# +------------------+
#
# The number of milliseconds we wait between polling for changes in remote

#
# PS_POLL_INTERVAL_MS="PT1M"


# +---------------+
# |  probationMs  |
# +---------------+
#
# Normally when subsystems crash, PhotoStructure restarts them after a delay.
# Unfortunately, if there is a persistent error, this means PhotoStructure
# keeps trying something that won't ever work; it looks busy, but it's just
# busy failing. To prevent this situation, PhotoStructure will shut down if
# there are high error rates within 2 minutes of starting. (2 minutes should
# be long enough to spin up the web process, sync process, and import at least
# one pending file). Setting this to 0 will prevent PhotoStructure from
# exiting due to high error rates.
#
# PS_PROBATION_MS="PT2M"


# +-------------------+
# |  processPriority  |
# +-------------------+
#
# By default, PhotoStructure runs child processes with a "below normal"
# priority, so your system remains usable while imports run. Changing this
# value to "normal" or "above normal" may speed up imports but cause your
# system to be unresponsive. Changing this value to "idle" may prevent imports
# from running at all.
#
# Valid values: AboveNormal,Normal,BelowNormal,Idle
#
# PS_PROCESS_PRIORITY="BelowNormal"


# +----------------------+
# |  sensitiveEnvRegExp  |
# +----------------------+
#
# PhotoStructure spawns several external processes, including "exiftool" and
# "ffmpeg".
#
# PhotoStructure filters out environment keys  that are likely to contain
# sensitive information (like API access tokens or passwords) from these child
# processes so they aren't accidentally logged or accessible by external

# |  timeoutThrottleCoeff  |
# +------------------------+
#
# When timeouts are detected, PhotoStructure throttles back concurrency
# automatically, with the assumption that some system is currently being
# overwhelmed and that less load should result in fewer failures due to
# timeouts.
#
# Specifically, concurrency will be set to 1 / current rate of timeouts per
# minute over the past several minutes.
#
# Throttling will be more aggressive as this value approaches 0. For example a
# value of 0.1 will be very aggressive throttling. A value of 8 will only slow
# down sync after many soft timeouts.

# +-----------------------+
#
# What tags should PhotoStructure retain when building preview images? A
# partial list of tags is here:
# <https://photostructure.github.io/exiftool-vendored.js/interfaces/Tags.html>.
# Note that not all files contain all (or even some!) of those tags.
#
# "capturedAt" is a special meta-tag which will retain whatever tag contains
# the "best" time that PhotoStructure could find that encoded the date and
# time when the image was captured.
#
# Including "GPSLatitude" and "GPSLongitude" will mean previews will contain
# location metadata if the source image had location metadata.
#
# Set this to an empty array to strip all metadata tags from preview images.
#
# PS_INCLUDED_PREVIEW_TAGS="[\"AttributionName\",\"AttributionURL\",\"capturedAt\",\"Copyright\",\"License\",\"Make\",\"Model\",\"Permits\",\"Prohibits\",\"Requires\",\"Source\",\"UseGuidelines\"]"


# +-----------------+
# |  jpegMinimized  |
# +-----------------+
#
# Should preview JPEGs be optimized? If set, preview generation can take 50%
# longer, but can result in up to ~30% smaller images. This saves disk space
# and network transport time.
#
# This setting controls the "mozjpeg" option: see
# <https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-output#jpeg> for details.
#
# This automatically defaults to true if at least 6 CPU cores are present.
#
# PS_JPEG_MINIMIZED="true"


# +-------------------+
# |  jpegProgressive  |

#
# Should preview JPEGs be progressively encoded? If set, thumbnails will take
# ~15% longer to generate, but FHD/QHD/UHD previews will be smaller.
#
# PS_JPEG_PROGRESSIVE="true"


# +---------------+
# |  jpegQuality  |
# +---------------+
#
# JPEG output quality for previews. Smaller values produce smaller images with
# lower quality. The default value of 85 strikes a balance that has almost no
# noticeable compression artifacts, yet still compresses images reasonably
# well. Values less than ~50-70 can produce noticeable artifacts (depending on
# the image).
#
# Min value: 10
# Max value: 100
#
# PS_JPEG_QUALITY="85"


# +----------------------+
# |  previewResolutions  |
# +----------------------+
#
# This controls the resolutions that PhotoStructure creates for every asset.
# Note that resolutions will be skipped if there already is a preview value
# with 2.5x the megapixels, so even though there are a lot of sizes here,
# you'll only see 3-4 images on your disk per asset.

# PS_SKIP_PREVIEWS="false"


# +-----------------------+
# |  squareThumbStrategy  |
# +-----------------------+
#
# When PhotoStructure crops images and videos to square thumbnails, it needs
# to crop non-square images to a square. The default, "attention," focuses on
# faces and higher image energy, but is more expensive than simply cropping to
# the center of the image (which is faster, but will mean less-nice cropping,
# where faces are chopped in half). More details are available here:

#
# How should PhotoStructure pick the "best" asset file variant for a given
# asset? You may reorder the default fields. Only "resolution", "fileSize",
# "mtime", "schemeIdx", "isCover", "count", and "isBrowserSupported" are
# understood: other field names will be ignored. Details about these fields

# +----------------------------+
# |  variantSortCriteriaPower  |
# +----------------------------+
#
# Variant sort criteria "resolution" and "fileSize" are scaled down to ignore
# irrelevant differences. Scalars are raised to this power to reduce them, so
# a value of 1 means the criterion is unchanged from the "raw" value. Smaller
# values for this setting let _larger_ differences be ignored.
#
# Min value: 0.000001
# Max value: 1
#
# PS_VARIANT_SORT_CRITERIA_POWER="0.15"


# +-------------------+
# |  videoFrameAtSec  |
# +-------------------+
#
# When capturing a frame from videos for thumbnails, how many seconds should
# be passed over before capturing a frame? A value of 0 means capture from the
# start of the video. Frequently, though, videos start out of focus, so we
# default to 1.5 for better frame clarity.
#
# Note that if a video is shorter than this value, the frame will be captured
# from the middle of the video.

# Settings for Library.subscriptions:

# +----------------------+
# |  autoRefreshLicense  |
# +----------------------+
#
# PhotoStructure uses cryptographically signed licenses to locally store your
# current plan subscription status. These licenses are only valid for the
# current subscription period, and must be refreshed when your subscription
# renews or converts from a free trial to a paid subscription. To minimize the
# hassle of license renewals, PhotoStructure can automatically renew expired
# licenses in the background.
#
# If the current license has expired and this value is true, PhotoStructure
# will make one secure POST request to https://account.photostructure.com/
# that contains several lossy one-way hashes of current system metadata. We
# hash all identifying metadata to only 15 characters to alleviate any privacy
# concerns. If your plan subscription is active, a new license will be added
# to your library.
#
# Set this to false and set the "reportErrors" setting to false if you don't
# want PhotoStructure "phoning home" for any reason.
#
# Note that if this is disabled, license renewals will require manual
# intervention: click "Upgrade" from the main menu, pick your plan,
# authenticate, and the license will automatically refresh.
#
# PS_AUTO_REFRESH_LICENSE="true"


# +-----------+
# |  license  |
# +-----------+
#
# Subscription licenses are normally saved automatically into both your
# library and system configuration directories. This setting just provides
# users with an alternative way to provide a license, if it's more convenient.
# Any value provided to this setting will be considered in addition to
# existing license files when PhotoStructure is trying to find the "best"
# license available.
#
# PS_LICENSE=""


# +---------------------+
# |  pickPlanOnWelcome  |
# +---------------------+
#
# If set to true, the welcome page flow will redirect to
# https://account.photostructure.com/plans to have you pick between "plus" and
# "lite". If set to false, the welcome page will continue directly to the
# settings page with a "lite" license. You can still upgrade to a paid plan
# later from the main menu or the about page, even if this is false.
