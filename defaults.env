# +-----------------------+
# |  copyAssetsToLibrary  |
# +-----------------------+
#
# Should PhotoStructure copy photos and videos to your PhotoStructure Library?
# This setting holds the value for the welcome page's "May PhotoStructure
# organize your photos and videos?" section. Read more about this setting

#
# PS_SCAN_ALL_DRIVES="true"


# +------------------+
# |  scanMyPictures  |
# +------------------+
#
# Deprecated, and will be removed in the next version. If set, PhotoStructure
# will automatically add your pictures directory to your `scanPaths` setting
# and then flip this setting back to false.
#
# PS_SCAN_MY_PICTURES="false"


# +-------------+
# |  scanPaths  |
# +-------------+
#
# This holds an array of absolute paths to scan for assets. If you are setting
# this via an environment variable, you may use either standard PATH
# formatting, like `PS_SCAN_PATHS="/path/one:/path/two"`, or use JSON
# encoding, like `PS_SCAN_PATHS='["/path/one","/path/two"]'`.
#
# PS_SCAN_PATHS=""


# +------------+
# |  cacheDir  |
# +------------+
#
# Where would you like PhotoStructure's scratch file directory? This must be a
# fast, local disk with several gigabytes free. Note that if
# PS_FORCE_LOCAL_DB_REPLICA is enabled, the local DB replica will be stored in
# this directory.
#
# PS_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/photostructure"


# +-----------------------+
# |  forceLocalDbReplica  |
# +-----------------------+
#
# Libraries on remote filesystems can suffer from bad performance and
# inconsistent transactions due to slow file I/O and missing file locking
# mechanics. When opening libraries on remote filesystems, or if this setting
# is `true`, PhotoStructure will copy the library database to the `cacheDir`
# and perform I/O against this local replica. Changes made to the local db
# replica are then periodically copied back to the remote library.
#

# +----------------+
# |  originalsDir  |
# +----------------+
#
# This is the directory that PhotoStructure uses to store original images when
# "copyAssetsToLibrary" is enabled. Absolute paths are supported. Relative
# paths are evaluated from your libraryDir. This setting defaults to ".",
# which is the same as your PhotoStructure library directory.
#
# If you open your PhotoStructure library on a different computer, and that
# computer doesn't have access to your originals volume, full-screen zoom
# won't work, and non-transcoded videos will not play.
#
# This system setting needs to be set appropriately on different computers (it
# won't be set automatically!)
#
# If you have a large library and want to use an SSD, we recommend you set
# your libraryDir to your SSD, and use this setting to store your originals on
# a larger volume, rather than using the "previewsDir" setting.
#
# See
# <https://forum.photostructure.com/t/hybrid-photostructure-libraries/775>.

# +---------------+
# |  previewsDir  |
# +---------------+
#
# This is the directory that PhotoStructure uses to store preview images. This
# defaults to the ".photostructure/previews" directory inside your
# PhotoStructure library. Absolute paths here are supported, but if you keep
# your library and previews directory separated, take care when you open your
# library on different computers, as this setting needs to be adjusted for
# those computers as well.
#
# NOTE: "originalDirs" is recommended instead of this setting; If you get
# "previewsDir" wrong, your library won't work. If you get "originalsDir"
# wrong, you just break full-screen asset zooming and playback for
# non-transcoded videos.

#
# Settings for System.networking:
#


# +----------------------------+
# |  exposeNetworkWithoutAuth  |
# +----------------------------+
#
# Normally the web service is only accessible to the computer running
# PhotoStructure. Setting this to true will expose your library to all
# computers on your network. You should own or trust all systems on that
# network, as there is no auth in PhotoStructure currently. Future versions of

# +-------------+
# |  localhost  |
# +-------------+
#
# If "exposeNetworkWithoutAuth" is false, what value should PhotoStructure use

# +--------------+
# |  trustProxy  |
# +--------------+
#
# Support for PhotoStructure instances running behind a reverse proxy. See
# <http://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html>. This setting should

#
# Settings for System.processes:
#


# +------------------+
# |  cpuLoadPercent  |
# +------------------+
#
# PhotoStructure runs many things in parallel during library synchronization.
# The maximum number of concurrent file imports that PhotoStructure will
# schedule at a time will be the number of CPUs that this system has
# multiplied by this percent. A higher value here will allow PhotoStructure to
# run more tasks in parallel, but may impact your system's responsiveness. 75%
# should be a reasonable balance between keeping your system responsive and
# importing your library quickly. Setting this value to 0 will still allow 1
# task to run concurrently. System memory will also be taken into account to
# try to prevent swapping.
#
# This setting is ignored if "maxSyncFileJobs" and "sharpThreadsPerJob" are
# set.
#
# Min value: 0
# Max value: 200
#
# PS_CPU_LOAD_PERCENT="75"


# +-------------------------+
# |  exiftoolProcsPerChild  |
# +-------------------------+
#
# Each PhotoStructure process spins up an ExifTool when needed. Note that the
# `web`, `sync`, and `sync-file` services all use exiftool, so the total
# number of exiftool processes can be many times larger than this value.
#
# Min value: 1
# Max value: 8
#
# PS_EXIFTOOL_PROCS_PER_CHILD="2"


# +---------------------------+
# |  fatalErrorRatePerMinute  |
# +---------------------------+
#
# If PhotoStructure sees errors at a higher rate per minute than this setting,
# PhotoStructure will shut down. If this value is too high, PhotoStructure may
# look busy, but it's just busyfailing. If this value is set too low,
# temporary errors (due to network flakiness or USB hiccups) might shut down
# PhotoStructure needlessly.
#
# PS_FATAL_ERROR_RATE_PER_MINUTE="10"


# +-----------+
# |  inspect  |
# +-----------+
#
# Should processes run with --inspect? This should only be enabled
# temporarily, as it impacts both performance and security.
#
# This setting is transient and only set via environment variables.
#
#
# PS_INSPECT="false"


# +---------------+
# |  maxMemoryMb  |
# +---------------+
#
# PhotoStructure will restart services if they use more than this value
# (measured in megabytes, or 1,000,000 bytes). Note that this is not the
# allocated memory. See maxRssMemoryMb for total allocated.
#
# Min value: 0
# Max value: 8000
#
# PS_MAX_MEMORY_MB="500"


# +------------------+

# Min value: 0
# Max value: 8000
#
# PS_MAX_RSS_MEMORY_MB="1024"


# +-------------------+
# |  maxSyncFileJobs  |
# +-------------------+
#
# How many concurrent "sync-file" jobs can run during an import? This will be
# clamped between 1 and 24.
#
# This and "sharpThreadsPerJob" override "cpuLoadPercent".
#
# PS_MAX_SYNC_FILE_JOBS=""


# +----------------------+
# |  maxTasksPerProcess  |
# +----------------------+
#
# PhotoStructure will recycle sync-file processes after they handle this
# number of requests. Smaller values may reduce overall memory pressure.
# Larger values amortize startup costs over fewer restarts.
#
# Min value: 1
# Max value: 5000
#
# PS_MAX_TASKS_PER_PROCESS="250"


# +-----------------+
# |  minDiskFreeGb  |
# +-----------------+
#
# PhotoStructure will pause processing if the GB free on the disk that your
# library is stored on drops below this value. The value provided here will be
# multiplied by 1000^3. Note that many OSes will corrupt themselves when disks
# fill up, and SSDs can fail as they approach full capacity. A value of less
# than 8 may be unsafe (due to hibernation and os update files).
#
# PS_MIN_DISK_FREE_GB="6"


# +-----------------------------------+
# |  minTimeBetweenServiceRestartsMs  |
# +-----------------------------------+
#
# If a service (like web, sync, or sync-file) is restarted due to an error,
# how many ms must elapse before another restart is allowed? This helps
# prevent system load due to service flapping.
#
# PS_MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_SERVICE_RESTARTS_MS="7000"


# +------------------+
# |  pollIntervalMs  |
# +------------------+
#
# The number of milliseconds we wait between polling for changes in remote
# filesystems. This defaults to 1 minute, to minimize remote filesystem load.
#
# PS_POLL_INTERVAL_MS="60000"


# +---------------+
# |  probationMs  |
# +---------------+
#
# Normally when subsystems crash, PhotoStructure restarts them after a delay.
# Unfortunately, if there is a persistent error, this means PhotoStructure
# keeps trying something that won't ever work; it looks busy, but it's just
# busy failing. To prevent this situation, PhotoStructure will shut down if
# there are high error rates within 2 minutes of starting. (2 minutes should
# be long enough to spin up the web process, sync process, and import at least
# one pending file). Setting this to 0 will prevent PhotoStructure from
# exiting due to high error rates.
#
# PS_PROBATION_MS="120000"


# +-------------------+
# |  processPriority  |
# +-------------------+
#
# By default, PhotoStructure runs child processes with a "below normal"
# priority, so your system remains usable while imports run. Changing this
# value to "normal" or "above normal" may speed up imports but cause your
# system to be unresponsive. Changing this value to "idle" may prevent imports
# from running at all.
#
# Valid values: AboveNormal,Normal,BelowNormal,Idle
#
# PS_PROCESS_PRIORITY="BelowNormal"


# +----------------------+
# |  sensitiveEnvRegExp  |
# +----------------------+
#
# PhotoStructure spawns a number of processes (including "exiftool" and
# "ffmpeg"), and passes through environment variables, mostly to ensure locale
# and TZ settings are correct. To prevent environment values that contain
# sensitive information, like API access tokens, from either being logged, or
# being accessed by external tools, all environment variables whose key
# matches this setting will be removed. This regex is applied
# case-insensitively.
#
# PS_SENSITIVE_ENV_REG_EXP="key|secret|pass|_user|aws_"


# +------------------+
# |  setupTimeoutMs  |
# +------------------+
#
# To prevent unhealthy services running as zombies, they self-terminate if the
# setup processes are not complete within this amount of time. Note that only
# the environment variable value is used for this setting.
#
# PS_SETUP_TIMEOUT_MS="35000"


# +----------------------+
# |  sharpThreadsPerJob  |
# +----------------------+
#
# How many image processing threads can be spun per sync-file process? This
# will be clamped between 1 and 6.
#
# This and "maxSyncFileJobs" override "cpuLoadPercent".

# Settings for Library.subscriptions:

# +----------------------+
# |  autoRefreshLicense  |
# +----------------------+
#
# PhotoStructure uses cryptographically signed licenses to locally store your
# current plan subscription status. These licenses are only valid for the
# current subscription period, and must be refreshed when your subscription
# renews or converts from a free trial to a paid subscription. To minimize the
# hassle of license renewals, PhotoStructure can automatically renew expired
# licenses in the background.
#
# If the current license has expired and this value is true, PhotoStructure
# will make one secure POST request to https://account.photostructure.com/
# that contains several lossy one-way hashes of current system metadata. We
# hash all identifying metadata to only 15 characters to alleviate any privacy
# concerns. If your plan subscription is active, a new license will be added
# to your library.
#
# Set this to false and set the "reportErrors" setting to false if you don't
# want PhotoStructure "phoning home" for any reason.
#
# Note that if this is disabled, license renewals will require manual
# intervention: click "Upgrade" from the main menu, pick your plan,
# authenticate, and the license will automatically refresh.

# |  license  |
# +-----------+
#
# Subscription licenses are normally saved automatically into both your
# library and system configuration directories. This setting just provides
# users with an alternative way to provide a license, if it's more convenient.
# Any value provided to this setting will be considered in addition to
# existing license files when PhotoStructure is trying to find the "best"
# license available.

# If set to true, the welcome page flow will redirect to

# settings page with a "lite" license. You can still upgrade to a paid plan
# later from the main menu or the about page, even if this is false.
