## CHANGELOG / NOTES

# Prior to v1.0, PhotoStructure for Docker defaulted to running as root. To
# prevent upgrades from failing due to permission issues, let's default the UID
# and GID to match the current owner of the system settings.toml file.

# Prior to v2.1-alpha.4, PhotoStructure for Docker accepted both "UID" and
# "PUID" environment variables, but this can cause issues with some shells
# (like bash) that treat $UID as a read-only value. This script now only looks
# at $PUID and $PGID -- if your docker container setup set the environment
# variable $UID, please change it to $PUID.

# If $PUID or $PGID is not set, PhotoStructure will default to use the current
# owner of the system settings or library settings files. If both of those are
# missing, we default to root for both PUID and PGID.

# See <https://photostructure.com/go/puid> for more details.

# Prior to v2.1, this script would exit with a non-zero status if anything was
# amiss. It turns out that lots of users aren't running this image from a
# command line, and so this script really tries to get PhotoStructure spun up,
# and relies on error reporting from the splash screen. This should make it
# easier for all users to debug their installation setup.

# Prior to v2.1, if PUID/PGID was set, we'd _reuse_ the existing `node` user
# and group, and reassign the uid/gid. Unfortunately, the LTS node image (as
# of 2023) installs files in /opt/yarn which are owned by node:node, so
# reassigning the userid can be problematic. We now create a new
# `photostructure` user instead.

# As of v23.8, the photostructure code and resources were moved from /ps/...
# to /opt/photostructure to avoid being squashed by a typoed /ps user bind
# mounts.

# Note that this same entrypoint is used for the Debian and Alpine docker
# images, so this needs to run under busybox (for Alpine), and dash (for
# debian). Note that

# --- script starts here ---

# Propagate ctrl-c while we're still in this script:
trap 'exit 130' INT

# `node` is installed in /usr/local/bin, and we want that to win. Note that
# nothing within PhotoStructure assumes /opt/photostructure is in the PATH,
# but in case someone runs "photostructure" anywhere in the image, I'd rather
# it work.
export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/opt/photostructure:/opt/photostructure/bin:/opt/photostructure/tools/bin"

# PhotoStructure uses this environment variable to know that it's running in a
# docker container, and make a bunch of docker-specific setup, like health
# check registration and default PS_LIBRARY_DIR.

# This env had been set in the Dockerfile, but that makes PS_IS_DOCKER show up
# in some docker container managers, like portainer, which can be confusing.
# Previous versions used more "clever" am-I-in-docker detection heuristics,
# but this is simple and explicit.

# "production mode" (rather than "development mode").

# PhotoStructure settings are split into 2 different configurations--one
# "system" setting file that (mostly) tells PhotoStructure where the library
# is, and one "library" settings file where everything else is configured.

# That said, these `stats` calls are just to get a reasonable default user id
# and group id, in case PUID or PGID aren't set.

# We prefer /ps/config over /ps/library/... as /ps/config may be specific to
# this machine, whereas the library directory could be shared with other
# machines with different UID/GIDs.
