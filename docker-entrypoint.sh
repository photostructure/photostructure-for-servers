# Prior to v1.0, PhotoStructure for Docker defaulted to running as root. To
# prevent upgrades from failing due to permission issues, let's default the UID
# and GID to match the current owner of the system settings.toml file.

# Prior to v2.1-alpha.4, PhotoStructure for Docker accepted both "UID" and
# "PUID" environment variables, but this can cause issues with some shells
# (like bash) that treat $UID as a read-only value. This script now only looks
# at $PUID and $PGID -- if your docker container setup set the environment
# variable $UID, please change it to $PUID.

# If $PUID or $PGID is not set, PhotoStructure will default to use the current
# owner of the system settings or library settings files. If both of those are
# missing, we default to 1000 for both PUID and PGID, which are the default
# ids given to the first non-system user (at least in Ubuntu and Fedora).

# See <https://photostructure.com/go/puid> for more details.
