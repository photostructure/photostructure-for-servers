## CHANGELOG / NOTES

# Prior to v1.0, PhotoStructure for Docker defaulted to running as root. To
# prevent upgrades from failing due to permission issues, let's default the UID
# and GID to match the current owner of the system settings.toml file.

# Prior to v2.1-alpha.4, PhotoStructure for Docker accepted both "UID" and
# "PUID" environment variables, but this can cause issues with some shells
# (like bash) that treat $UID as a read-only value. This script now only looks
# at $PUID and $PGID -- if your docker container setup set the environment
# variable $UID, please change it to $PUID.

# If $PUID or $PGID is not set, PhotoStructure will default to use the current
# owner of the system settings or library settings files. If both of those are
# missing, we default to root for both PUID and PGID.

# See <https://photostructure.com/go/puid> for more details.

# Prior to v2.1, this script would exit with a non-zero status if anything was
# amiss. It turns out that lots of users aren't running this image from a
# command line, and so this script really tries to get PhotoStructure spun up,
# and relies on error reporting from the splash screen. This should make it
# easier for all users to debug their installation setup.

# Prior to v2.1, if PUID/PGID was set, we'd _reuse_ the existing `node` user
# and group, and reassign the uid/gid. Unfortunately, the LTS node image (as
# of 2023) installs files in /opt/yarn which are owned by node:node, so
# reassigning the userid can be problematic. We now create a new
# `photostructure` user instead.

# As of v2023.6, the photostructure code and resources were moved from /ps/...
# to /opt/photostructure to avoid being squashed by a typoed /ps user bind
# mounts.

# Note that this same entrypoint is used for the Debian and Alpine docker
# images, so this needs to run under busybox (for Alpine), and dash (for
# debian).
